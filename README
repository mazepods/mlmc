## TO-DOs
-[x] Project setup
-[x] Build system
-[ ] Fill Readme file
-[ ] Add a license file
-[ ] Will we be open to contributions? Add a contributing file

### Random Numbers Generator
-[ ] Create a header file rng.h
-[ ] Separate each rng implementation into its own file
-[ ] Add a timing implementation to test the different rng available

### Test Suite
-[ ] 

### Report, Plots, & Logging
-[ ] Create a logger.h library to manage all logging calls
-[ ] Find a convention for text output
-[ ] Generate pdfs and tex files dynamically
-[ ] Port matlab plotting code to C

### Utilities
-[ ] Move regression function to a util.h file

### Applications
-[ ] Separate poissinv file into a proper header and cpp file
-[ ] Remove rng embbeded code and use the rng.h instead
-[ ] Other Matlab applications to port?
-[ ] Add OMP support to the other applicaciones? ctmp runs the slowest
